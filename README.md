# SwapX Core

A secure and efficient decentralized token swap protocol built on Stacks blockchain, implementing automated market making (AMM) functionality for seamless token exchanges.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Automated Market Maker (AMM) using constant product formula
- Decentralized token swaps with minimal slippage
- Liquidity pool management
- Share tracking for liquidity providers

### Security
- Comprehensive authorization checks
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure token transfer handling
- Balance verification systems
- Protected admin functionality

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- `swap.clar`: Core swap functionality and pool management
- Token pair pools with automated price discovery
- Share tracking system for liquidity providers
- Read-only functions for pool statistics

### Mathematical Model
- Constant product formula (x * y = k)
- Automated price calculations based on pool ratios
- Slippage protection mechanisms

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet
- Node.js >= 14
- Stacks CLI

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swapx-core
cd swapx-core
clarinet integrate
```

### Testing

2. Deploy using Clarinet:
```bash
clarinet deploy --network testnet
```

## Security Considerations
- Owner-only pool initialization
- Protected liquidity management
- Secure token transfer handling
- Input validation on all public functions
- Balance checks before operations
